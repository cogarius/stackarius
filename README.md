## Important ! troubleshooting: Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto'

Angular-cli uses a webpack.config that do not include the nodejs crypto lib.

```error
ERROR in ./node_modules/blockstack/lib/keys.js
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto' in 'node_modules/blockstack/lib'
```

#### solution applied to this repo

- intall dev depencency `$ npm i -D @angular-builders/custom-webpack`
- modify your angular.json change the @angular-devkit/build-angular:browser builder to @angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser
- create a new file `webpack.config.js` under your root folder (next to package.json)
- If you want to run ng serve with custom webpack configuration (given you performed all the above steps) `$ npm i -D @angular-builders/dev-server`
- in angular.json  in the "serve" step, replaces _@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server_ by _@angular-builders/dev-server:generic_
